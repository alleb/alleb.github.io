        Dear Mr. & Mrs.,<br/><br/>
        I am writing in recommendation of Tianlong Tang who is our current Accounting & Finance Intern. Tianlong has been contributing to PeopleFund since June 2013.<br/><br/>
        I feel as though Tianlong would be an asset to any organization that he works with. He is a fast-learner and detail-oriented. I am very impressed with his commitment to our organization. As an unpaid intern, he as devoted substantial time and energy to learning about our mission and the clientâ€™s we serve.<br/><br/>
        He is willing to accept any task and see it through to completion. He not only is very accurate with his work product, but he also attempts to learn as much information from the project. I have given him not only Accounting tasks but Underwriting and Lending tasks to complete. Other members of our Management Team have gone out of their way to let me know that they enjoy working with Tianlong and are impressed with his skill set.<br/><br/>
        I am a former Assurance Manager with KPMG and would gladly have had Tianlong as a member of my staff. Tianlong has been named our Intern of the Year for 2013 and will be honored this month during our Gala.<br/><br/>
        Please feel free to contact me if you should have any questions or need further information.<br/><br/>
        Sincerely,<br/><br/>
        Julia Dunn<br/><br/>
        CFO</p>
